1. **Mirzosharif Habibov.**
Over the past two months of working with our team and mentor, Ms. Zulfiya, I have gained experience in working with large language models (LLMs), learned the fundamentals of conducting research, and developed an understanding of multi-agent systems (although I have not yet experimented with them directly). My main contributions were in coding and analysis. Specifically, I evaluated different LLMs on their ability to mimic human opinions when provided with persona backgrounds, collected their responses, and compared them with actual human responses. In addition, I explored the behavior of LLMs under varying conditions to observe how their outputs change in different contexts.

2. **Husan Samandarov.**
My primary contribution to this research was focused on data collection, research structuring, and data analysis. I helped collect as many human responses as possible and took part in formulating survey questions, ensuring they remained simple while incorporating a slight degree of controversy to stimulate diverse opinions. I also structured the research abstract, introduction, literature review, and methodology of our thesis. After collecting all responses from both humans and LLMs, I contributed to the data analysis, identifying key differences and similarities between the two, in order to determine the relationship and validity of LLMs in mimicking human opinions.

3. **Muhammadyusuf Hakimov.**
As for the contribution I've made to specific project is that I have actively participated in all the lessons except for the one. Then we have made ourselves aware of the project by reading a lot of materials. I hope I've done my best to finish them all. Experiment 3 was totally my part, and I have done my best to successfully complete it. I have made an appealing excel file for visualization of the results gotten from the LLM models. I'd like you to see the results in terms of the report paper along with the presentation.

4. **Malikaxon Musajonova.**
Over the past two months of working with our team and mentor, I contributed mainly to data collection, research design, and analysis. I gathered human responses, encouraged participation from diverse groups, and helped design survey questions that were simple yet slightly controversial to generate varied opinions. I also worked on the “contribution to knowledge” section of our research and prepared a detailed analysis of human responses in a separate document file, which was later used as a basis for comparing them with LLM-generated outputs.
